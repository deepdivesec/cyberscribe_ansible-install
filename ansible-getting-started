Ansible Getting Started:

- Ensure Python3 is on both Ansible controller and managed nodes.  

- Install Ansible (yum|dnf|<other package manager> install ansible)

- Ensure you have an SSH key to copy to your managed nodes (ssh-keygen -t rsa)

- Copy this key over to the managed nodes (ssh-copy-id root@<managed server>)

- Note: you can authenticate via different methods, and escalate privileges via sudo as well)

- Place your managed nodes in the /etc/ansible/hosts file

- Test out the documentation command `ansible-doc -l` and see what is available

- Test out connectivity (within Ansible) to managed nodes: ansible all -m ping

- Ready to write and run playbooks!

- Run playbooks with ansible-playbook <playbook> command

- Check for errors with ansible-playbook --check <playbook>

- Install and use ansible-lint for further checking

- Set up playbooks either in Cron jobs, scripts, manually, via Ansible Tower, or however you want to manage your environment
